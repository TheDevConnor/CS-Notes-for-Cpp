Problem Statement:
A Theater you are opening needs a program to calculate how much income was
generated from each sales of different box office seats. The program should ask
the user for the number of each type of box office seat sold for the night and
then output the total for each type of seat and the overall total. There are
five types of seats, Balcony, Grand Tier, Loge, Mezzanine, and Orchestra.

The pricing is as follows:
Balcony: $50.00
Grand Tier: $175.25
Loge: $125.00
Mezzanine: $100.00
Orchestra: $230.50

Variable List:
Identifier   | Description                           | Data Type | Source          | Usage       
-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------
x            | Temporary variable for seat count input | float     | User input      | Calculation 
mezzanine    | Cost per seat for mezzanine seating   | float     | Hardcoded value | Calculation 
balcony      | Cost per seat for balcony seating     | float     | Hardcoded value | Calculation 
loge         | Cost per seat for loge seating        | float     | Hardcoded value | Calculation 
grandTier    | Cost per seat for grand tier seating | float     | Hardcoded value | Calculation 
orchestra    | Cost per seat for orchestra seating   | float     | Hardcoded value | Calculation 
total        | Total sales amount                    | float     | Calculation     | Output      

Algorithum:
1. Start
2. Declare and initialize variables:
   - x (temporary variable for seat count input) as float
   - mezzanine (cost per seat for mezzanine seating) as float, initialized with 100
   - balcony (cost per seat for balcony seating) as float, initialized with 50
   - loge (cost per seat for loge seating) as float, initialized with 125
   - grandTier (cost per seat for grand tier seating) as float, initialized with 175.25
   - orchestra (cost per seat for orchestra seating) as float, initialized with 230.50
   - total (total sales amount) as float
   
3. Prompt the user for the number of seats sold for each seating type:
   a. Prompt for balcony seating count and store in x
   b. Prompt for grand tier seating count and store in x
   c. Prompt for loge seating count and store in x
   d. Prompt for mezzanine seating count and store in x
   e. Prompt for orchestra seating count and store in x

4. Calculate the total sales for each seating type:
   a. Multiply the number of seats sold for each seating type by its respective cost per seat
   b. Assign the result to the respective seating type variable (balcony, grandTier, loge, mezzanine, orchestra)

5. Display the total sales for each seating type and the overall total sales:
   a. Display "WallStreet Theater Ticket Sales"
   b. Display "-------------------------------"
   c. Display "Balcony:     $" followed by the value of balcony
   d. Display "Grand Tier:  $" followed by the value of grandTier
   e. Display "Loge:        $" followed by the value of loge
   f. Display "Mezzanine:   $" followed by the value of mezzanine
   g. Display "Orchestra:   $" followed by the value of orchestra
   h. Calculate the total sales by summing up the values of balcony, grandTier, loge, mezzanine, and orchestra
   i. Display "Total Sales: $" followed by the value of total

6. End
